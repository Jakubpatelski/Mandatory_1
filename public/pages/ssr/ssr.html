<h1>1. How does client-side rendering work? </h1>
<p>Client-side rendering (CSR) is the default rendering method for single-page applications.</p>
<p>In web development, rendering means the process of converting application code into interactive web pages. The page HTML is generated by a JavaScript engine. With client-side rendering, this is always done on the frontend. The browser then takes the generated HTML to visually render the page.</p>
<p>If you use client-side rendering, it’s the user’s browser that generates the entire app, including the user interface (UI), data, and functionality. No server is involved in the process, except to store the client-side code and data and transfer it to the browser.</p>
<p>Since the browser needs to download and run the whole application code before the content appears on the screen, the first page load is usually slow with client-side rendering (server-side rendering splits this process between the client and server).</p>
<h1>2. SSR - server side rendering</h1>
<p>Server-side rendering (SSR) convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client. Search engines can search index content prior to delivery, which is beneficial for Search Engine Optimization purposes.</p>
<h1>3. Steps in the server-side rendering process</h1>
<p>An SSR app processes the same JavaScript code on both the client and server side — this is why it’s also called universal rendering.</p>
<p>In brief, server-side rendering consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Client’s HTTP request – When the user enters the URL into the browser’s address bar, it establishes an HTTP connection with the server, then sends the server a request for the HTML document.</li>
    <li>Data fetching – The server fetches any required data from the database or third-party APIs.</li>
    <li>Server-side pre-rendering – The server compiles the JavaScript components into static HTML.</li>
    <li>Server’s HTTP response – The server sends this HTML document to the client.</li>
    <li>Page load and rendering– The client downloads the HTML file and displays the static components on the page.</li>
    <li>Hydration – The client downloads the JavaScript file(s) embedded into the HTML, processes the code, and attaches event listeners to the components. This process is also called hydration or rehydration.</li>
</ol>

<h1>4. What are the Benefits of Server-Side Rendering?</h1>
<p>Some server-side rendering advantages include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.</li>
    <li>When rendering server-side, search engines can easily index content because the content can be rendered before the page is loaded, which is ideal for SEO.</li>
    <li>Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.</li>
    <li>Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Server-Side Rendering vs Client-Side Rendering</h1>
  <p>In client-server rendering, rather than receiving all of the content from the HTML document, content is rendered in the browser using the client-side JavaScript library. The browser does not make a new request to the server when a new page is loaded. Search engine rankings may be negatively impacted as the content is not rendered until the page is loaded on the browser, however, website rendering tends to be faster in client-side
     rendered app.</p>
